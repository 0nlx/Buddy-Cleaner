\
**Overview:**\
The Buddy Antivirus Tool is a Python-based command-line utility designed to scan directories for viruses, quarantine infected files, extract files, and monitor directories for virus activity. It utilizes the ClamAV antivirus engine for scanning purposes.\
\
**Key Features:**\
1. **Scanning for Viruses:** Users can initiate a scan of a specified directory to check for any infected files.\
2. **Quarantine Functionality:** Infected files detected during scans can be moved to a quarantine directory to prevent further harm.\
3. **File Extraction:** There is provision to extract and open specific files for further analysis.\
4. **Monitoring:** Users can monitor a directory continuously for a specified duration to detect any virus activity.\
5. **Development Mode:** Offers insights into upcoming features and customization options.\
\
**Code Review:**\
- **Imported Libraries:** The code imports necessary libraries such as os, sys, time, shutil, clamd, logging, and colorama for various functionalities including file operations, antivirus scanning, logging, and output formatting.\
- **Logging:** Logging is implemented to track errors and actions performed by the tool, providing a record for troubleshooting.\
- **ClamAV Integration:** The `initialize_clamav()` function initializes the ClamAV antivirus engine using a Unix socket.\
- **Scan Functionality:** The `scan_directory()` function iterates through files in a directory and scans them for viruses using the ClamAV client.\
